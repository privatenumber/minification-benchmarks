## 👟 Methodology

- Each minifier is executed in its own process with a 20 second timeout
- _"Time"_ is the average of 5 consecutive runs
- _"Minzipped size"_ (minified & gzipped) measures how well the minified file compresses with Gzip
- Results are sorted by smallest minzipped size
- Each _"Time"_ is annotated with a multiplier relative to the fastest minifier
- Minified artifacts are validated by a smoke test
- Minified artifacts can be downloaded and verified in each [action run](https://github.com/privatenumber/minification-benchmarks/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml)

## 🥇 Results

### Best minification performance
[UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) takes first place for the smallest uncompressed minified size for all races, and wins 9 out of 11 races for minzipped size! Impressively, it's still written in ES5 but can handle ES6 up to ES2020.

[Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) takes a very close second, only short by at most by 1% in minzipped size while performing twice as fast as Uglify! Terser is a fork of UglifyJS and comes with support for ES6+.

### Fastest minifier
[esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) runs _10x_+ laps around everyone else! The Go-lang JS minifier/bundler is a beast of its own. Not only is it insanely fast, but demonstrates very competitive minification abilities, usually performing closely to Terser while supporting cutting-edge [ESNext syntax](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#javascript). However, note that esbuild has a [limited set of optimizations](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/639#:~:text=i%20can%20add%20a%20caveat%20to%20esbuild's%20minification%20documentation%20about%20code%20optimizations%20that%20are%20not%20included%20in%20esbuild.%20i%20think%20the%20list%20of%20possible%20code%20optimizations%20that%20esbuild%20doesn't%20do%20would%20be%20something%20like%20this%3A) and there are currently [no plans to improve it](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/639#issuecomment-792033958).

_⚡️ Pro Tip: Harness the speed of esbuild in your Webpack build for minification (and even transpilation) with [esbuild-loader](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader)._

Definitely keep an eye out for [swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc), the JS compiler written in Rust. It's also blazing fast and rumor has it they're stepping up their minification.
