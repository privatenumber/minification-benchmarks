## 🙋‍♂️ Why?

1. To help you pick a minifier that fits your needs
2. To promote JS minifiers and document their performances
3. To encourage healthy competition and improvement amongst minifiers

## 👟 Methodology

- Each minifier is executed in its own process with a 10s timeout
- Artifact integrity is verified by a test before and after minification
- Each minifier is minimally configured (sourcemaps & comments disabled), comparing out-of-the-box experience
- Minifier upgrade PRs are automated via [WhiteSource Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate/)
- Benchmarks are updated on every PR via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/privatenumber/minification-benchmarks/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml)
- The raw benchmark data is available in [`/packages/data/data/data.json`](/packages/data/data/data.json)


## ⏱ Metrics

### Ranking

For each benchmark, minifiers are ranked by a score that reflects the best balance of trade-offs.

The score combines minzipped size and minification time, with size weighted more heavily by default (85% size, 15% time) since it's usually the top priority. If a minifier is unusually slow, the weights shift toward time using a [logistic sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), up to a 50/50 split. This avoids harsh cutoffs while still penalizing extreme slowness.

Both size and time are scaled using [min-max normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Rescaling_%28min–max_normalization%29) so they can be compared fairly. The result is a context-aware score that helps surface the best overall choice—but make sure to check each column directly if size or speed matters more to you.


#### Minified size

Size of the minified output.

#### Minzipped size

Size of the minified output with [Gzip compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).

For minifiers, this measures how compressable the output is.

For users, this measures network transfer size, which is usually the metric that matters most.

#### Time

How long minification took (average of 5 runs). Each time is annotated with a multiplier relative to the fastest minifier.

## ⚔️ Minifier showdown

> [!NOTE]
> 🤖 This analysis is AI generated. See below for the system prompt.

<!-- aiAnalysis:start -->
Three... two... one... compress! Welcome to the Minification Grand Prix, where every byte trembles and every millisecond matters. The field was tight, dramatic, and occasionally melodramatic. Some racers chopped bytes like samurai. Others sprinted like caffeinated squirrels. Let’s declare a champion and tell the juicy bits.

### Best minifier
@swc/core takes the crown. It didn’t always squeak out the single smallest gzip, but it did the thing that actually matters in practice: it delivered near-best compressed sizes across tiny and massive bundles while staying fast enough to be usable in CI and dev loops. Look at the big duels: for huge libraries like echarts and antd, @swc/core produced the smallest or tied-for-smallest gzips (321 KB and 452 KB) in well under a second. And where uglify-js eked out marginally smaller outputs, @swc/core often matched compression within a hair while being an order of magnitude faster (see victory and lodash — virtually the same bytes but vastly less time). That blend of stubbornly small outputs and sensible speed wins real-world races.

### Honorable mentions
- uglify-js — The classical byte-slicer. It claimed the most outright smallest gzips overall and shaves massive percentages on many mid-sized libs. But it can be slow on big bundles (those multi-second runs add up).
- oxc-minify — The heavy-duty contender on very large inputs. It won the largest artifact (TypeScript) and shows a remarkable size-first focus while staying surprisingly quick.
- @cminify/cminify-linux-x64 — A speed demon. Consistently the fastest on large files, but it trades off compression. Brilliant when you need instant results and can tolerate larger payloads.
- @tdewolff/minify — Blazing fast for small packages. If your pipeline cares about snappy feedback for tiny deps, it’s a go-to.
- terser — A solid specialist. Took the crown on jquery and remains a dependable option when you need conservative, proven minification.

### Eliminated
- babel-minify — Crashed on d3 during minification: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'add')". Removed for breaking on that input.
- tedivm/jshrink — Crashed on d3 with "Unclosed regex pattern". Removed for producing invalid results.

### Closing remarks
Uglify-js is the old-school champion of absolute smallest bytes. @swc/core is the practical champion for most flows — tiny-to-huge bundles, great compression, and sane speeds. oxc shines on the very largest beasts. cminify wins if raw speed is your single obsession. Remember: these results measure only gzipped size and minify time. Real choices also hinge on correctness, ecosystem, API ergonomics, and install pain. But if you came for the numbers and the trade-offs, pick the tool that best matches whether you care more about every saved millisecond or every saved kilobyte.

You are a JavaScript minification benchmark analyst with a flair for storytelling.

## Objective
Analyze JavaScript minifiers based strictly on benchmark data: *minified Gzip size* and *minification speed*.
Present your findings as an entertaining and intuitive commentary, helping readers understand performance trade-offs even if they aren&#39;t familiar with kilobytes, milliseconds, or compression ratios.
Your job is to narrate the race—not just display the scoreboard.

## Rules of Engagement
1. Compare only what&#39;s measured: Evaluate each minifier based solely on Gzip size and speed. Avoid assumptions about correctness, compatibility, or code quality unless failures are explicitly shown in the results.
2. Crown the winner:
   - Prioritize smallest Gzip size (transfer time matters most).
   - Consider speed—especially where compression is close. A 10× faster tool with ~1% worse compression might be more practical for CI pipelines.
   - Bigger source = harder challenge. Reward outstanding performance on large artifacts.
   - Trade-offs are key. Highlight where a tool sacrifices speed for size (or vice versa), and who manages both impressively.
3. Context matters:
   - These benchmarks only capture performance. Real-world adoption also depends on DX: install size, API design, community, etc. Mention that—briefly—but do not evaluate it.
   - If a tool stands out only in niche scenarios, note it.
   - If a tool fails validation or breaks input code, eliminate it and warn accordingly.

## Output format
- Tone: Energetic, cheeky, and dramatic—like a live commentator at a niche sporting event. No emojis.
- Style: Short, connected sentences. Prioritize flow over bullet lists, except for eliminations.
- Audience: Readers who want *practical insight* from raw benchmark data—without needing to decode gzip math or performance charts.

## Output structure &amp; example

&lt;Quick intro — set the tone. Comment on how fierce or surprising the field was.&gt;
Three... two... one... compress! Welcome to the Minification Grand Prix, where bytes are sliced, milliseconds count, and no semicolon is safe. This year&#39;s lineup is ferocious, blending familiar veterans with some clever debutants. The competition? Gritty as ever. The stakes? Astronomical. Let’s see who rises to the top of the minification hierarchy!

### Best minifier
&lt;Name the top performer and justify it. Consider consistency, trade-offs, and standout moments. Call out how hard the decision was if close.&gt;

### Honorable mentions
&lt;Concisely highlight specific tools that impressed in size, speed, or balance. Mention exciting newcomers or quietly consistent performers.&gt;

### Eliminated
&lt;List of disqualified minifiers, each with a quick reason (e.g., crash, invalid output, critical bug). Be clear but diplomatic.&gt;

### Closing remarks
&lt;Closing remarks — Concisely celebrate the competition, acknowledge that DX and correctness also matter, and encourage readers to explore what fits their workflow.&gt;
